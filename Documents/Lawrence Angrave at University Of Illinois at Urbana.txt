Honestly struggled in this class because I was taking tough courses, but every time i showed up to lecture it felt fresh and fun. By far one of the best lecturers I've taken! We get worksheets to follow along which are great :) He's very supportive and understanding, he knows when to be tough yet is forgiving and understanding.

He is an outstanding professor and teaches incredibly. If you don't like live lectures he has an archive of past lectures, and if you don't like lectures his online textbook is incredibly helpful as well. Start on MPs early and you should be good to go.

The practice exam is not related to the final exam AT ALL, which was released just the day after the course eval was closed to avoid students' bad ratings. There were also many typos in the final exam, and the TAs and the professor clarified nothing and told us to figure them out ourselves. His TAs' piazza answers are usually short and unhelpful.
Lots of homework

Amazing lecturer, among the best. Very knowledgeable, makes class entertaining and easy to understand. Class has excessively difficult MPs. Every MP are two steps abstracted from lecture. Tons of documentation, but it takes me hours just to understand how to get started. Difficult quizzes. For normal semesters, no free points. Do everything.

I normally don't show up to lectures, but I showed up to nearly all of his. I thought 241 was the most difficult class I ever took, however it was also my favorite.

SO overrated. Lectures better than most, BUT: class is structured and organized horribly, disjointed assignment topics, unhelpful TAs, autograders that crash, heavily-weighted obscure multiple choice on quiz/exam, takes up a huge amount of time. Professor doesn't manage anything at all. Just an awful class experience, hated every second of it.

He is an awesome lecturer! He's got a bunch of fun extra materials about the course content. The course is not particularly hard if you have prior experience in C and some networking stuff. MPs are a big part.

The class in general was badly-run and badly-supported by the infrastructure. But Angrave's lectures were amazing and I learned a lot even with all the problems. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you REALLY need to know the material if you decide to skip lecturethe TAs in discussion and lab are unreliable help if you miss something important.

Second time taking a class with Angrave (first time was with CS125) and he is the best lecturer I've ever taken between preparedness and enthusiasm which makes going to class worth it.

This course is difficult, I can see that Angrave tried best to make this course more fascinating. Some lectures are really interesting but some lectures, such as those on file system and part II signals, because of lack of practice of labs, quizzes and mps, really make students confused. But in general, this course is awesome.

Fantastic lecturer. Keeps class informing and also entertaining, something which is very hard to do since some of the concepts are dry and syntax heavy. Difficult course in terms of workload but also very rewarding. You will walk out being an expert programmer in C and understanding how system programming is done.

CS 241 is hard. It takes a lot of time to finish all MPs and Labs. The material is messy. Final exam is extremely hard compared to midterms and quizzes. Wikibook is the best source for learning.

CS 241 definitely is hard and time consuming, be prepare. Angrave explain so well on the synchronization primitive. This class is worth if you are CS major. Start everything early, mps and labs will be fine. Make sure to work hard in the beginning because that is the hardest period. After that, the course will start getting easier. Good luck.

CS 241 is an overall hard class. The MPs and Lab will take up a lot of time out of your week. Its difficult to start early but Do it!. The midterms are fairly reasonable if you do the MPs and Labs and fully understand them. For the final, the rumors are true it is much much harder than then midterms but on equal level of the quizzes.

Great lecturer on very thought-provoking material. Some of the MPs and labs are tough, but the midterms are generally much easier. He promotes a friendly and engaging atmosphere, and really knows his stuff.
