Lawrence Angrave was a highly successful science student at RLS during the 1980’s. His Mum tells me that she drove him to Oxford University on the day the Berlin Wall came down. More recently, Lawrence has been working in the States and for about two years he’s been a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois.His classes are large: Mum tells me that he has back to back classes of 260 students! To be fair, Lawrence has a team of staff working with him. Lawrence has received an award for teaching excellence, and here’s a typical rating from one of his students:
“One of the most charismatic teachers at the Universitiy. He loves his work, and he’ll make you love it too. While it was one of my trickier classes, it was the only class I loved to attend. Lectures are riddled with jokes and demonstrations. The difficult and abstract subject matter is made quite simple. Highly recommend Prof. Angrave.”
Well Done, Lawrence!
